# Oil-Change-Tracker
A simple Express + SQLite API for tracking vehicle oil changes. Includes database integration and end-to-end testing setup.
This is a small project I built to practice backend development and QA testing. Itâ€™s a simple Node.js + Express API connected to a SQLite database that keeps track of oil changes for a vehicle.
