# Oil-Change-Tracker
A simple Express + SQLite API for tracking vehicle oil changes. Includes database integration and end-to-end testing setup.
This is a small project I built to practice backend development and QA testing. Itâ€™s a simple Node.js + Express API connected to a SQLite database that keeps track of oil changes for a vehicle.

What it Does
Add an oil change record (vehicle, mileage, date, notes)
Fetch all oil change records
Stores everything in a lightweight SQLite database
Clean route structure with Express
Ready to expand with automated tests (Jest + Supertest)
